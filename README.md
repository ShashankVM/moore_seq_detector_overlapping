# moore_seq_detector_overlapping
Formally verified "1011" overlapping sequence detector - Moore FSM
---

- This is a formally verified Moore FSM based overlapping sequence detector with registered outputs.
- **Tools & Technologies:** SystemVerilog, SystemVerilog Assertions, HW-CBMC
- **Results:** Assertion passing using Bounded Model Checking. Cover statements written and working visualized in the waveform.
- **Files & Directories:** 
   * seq_detector.sv: RTL design of "1011" overlapping sequence detector with registered outputs, Moore style. Contains formal properties and witness cover statement.
   * seq_detector.vcd: Dump file generated by EBMC for cover statements.
- **Run command:**
`ebmc seq_detector.sv --top seq_detector --bound 500 --reset reset==1 --vcd seq_detector.vcd > ebmc.log`

Unbounded model check:
k induction:
`ebmc seq_detector.sv --top seq_detector --k-induction --reset reset==1 > ebmc_k_induction.log`

BDD:
`ebmc seq_detector.sv --top seq_detector --bdd --reset reset==1 > ebmc_bdd.log`
